Final Output:
{
    "severity": "MEDIUM",
    "trade": "PLUMBING",
    "reasoning": "This is a persistent, contained kitchen faucet drip reported for the third time in two months indicating a failed repair or defective part rather than an acute safety event. There is no active flooding, electrical involvement, or health/safety risk, so it does not meet HIGH/EMERGENCY criteria, but recurrence warrants prompt diagnostic service and likely part replacement within 24-48 hours.",
    "confidence": 0.89,
    "key_factors": [
        "Recurring leak: 3rd report in 2 months (repeat failure)",
        "Contained dripping faucet — no active spreading or flooding",
        "Previous repair failed, likely needs deeper diagnosis or part replacement"
